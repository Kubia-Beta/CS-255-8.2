### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a design to aid new drivers in the acquisition of their license by way of technology. The client, DriverPass, wanted to fill in the market with this technology, linking them and their instructors to students for a fee. This was a web service design where students would connect to the website for DriverPass and be serviced by it. DriverPass wanted a system that was responsive to change and was flexible enough to allow for multiple learning plans.

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did well on the UML diagrams, both in explaining and in understanding them. I believe part of this comes from my familiarity with diagramming from my work in Computer Aided Drafting, also known as CAD. The high standards of good drafting require instilling a particular understanding of any kind of diagram of the importance of the design and sticking to conventions. Doing so increases the explanatory power of the diagram and makes it simpler to explain back into words what you put in picture.
 
### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would work on the non-functional requirements the most. Here my understanding was clearly at its weakest, particularly in relaying non-security issues. I feel my grasp, particularly on performance is where I struggled, and I found it surprisingly difficult to relay how fast or responsive the system should be. I think the best way to improve this would be to talk to my peers or my brother, as they may be able to relay how you think about non-functional requirements differently. That would allow me to have an entirely different approach when revising the statements.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I assumed that the general persona of a user would be similar to those of my coworkers when I was working at Mcdonald's. These are people of the right age and likely the target demographic of DriverPass, and I understood that one of their unspoken requirements is to have a frictionless interaction with the system they are using, such that the system itself should not ever be identified as the pain point, but that it could be their mobile internet connection or Wi-Fi.

The importance of this is that quite a lot of users can become easily frustrated and simply set their phone down or change over to something else when even small barriers are erected in their way. It can be helpful to remember that some of the target demographic would rather do something else than interact with a slow application, including paying for an alternative. This behavior is best observed in the lack of use in advertising blockers which save gigabytes of data and hours of time yearly for a few minutes of time.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Generally, I approach designing software the same way I approach a mathematical problem. There is a problem with a logical solution, but while the solution may be obvious, the difficult part is how the question is answered rather than the answer itself. However, typically in software development, there is a larger emphasis on diagramming the problem first, something that I am trying to incorporate into my own personal projects I the future. This includes making more UML diagrams to explore the problem and make the problem much easier to share with others, such that you can understand the process to solve it. This is a very different approach from mathematics, where a question is already in a form you can distribute and discuss about when simply written.
